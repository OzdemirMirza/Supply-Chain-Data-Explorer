 ## ‚ú® Features

- **Interactive Data Explorer:** View raw data from any table (`suppliers`, `parts`, `customers`, etc.) directly in the UI.
- **Customer Analysis by Color:** Filter and find customers who have placed orders involving parts of a specific color.
- **Single-Supplier Part Analysis:** List all orders for parts that are supplied by only one exclusive vendor.
- **Order Leader Analysis:** Identify the top customer by total quantity ordered for each individual part, using advanced SQL Window Functions.
- **Above-Average Price Analysis:** Find suppliers who are pricing a part higher than the average market price for that part.
- **Visual Documentation:** Each analysis page includes a flowchart explaining the logic of the underlying SQL query.

 ## üéØ Project Purpose & Learning Journey

This project serves as a practical milestone in my "baby steps" approach to mastering Data Engineering. The primary goal was to demonstrate proficiency in designing and building a data-intensive application from the ground up.

This application showcases the ability to:
- Design a relational database schema in PostgreSQL.
- Author complex, analytical SQL queries to derive business insights.
- Develop a data-driven, interactive web application using Python and Flask.
- Containerize a multi-service application (web server + database) with Docker and Docker Compose for portability and reproducibility.
